He was elated that he could finally get down to business, and possibly run into some of the demons he met on the outskirts previously...Playing a college kid again is going to be quite an experience...\n\nLysander confidently walks into his new room, taking time to soak in the atmosphere around him. For a supposed demon infested university, the dorms were pretty high quality, spacious, no roommates...And the amount of amenities offered to this school, there must be some wealthy characters who attend this college...Which also meant that there could be aristocratic and high rank demons \"attending\" as well. \n\nNo matter, he is nothing more than an informant for now. \n\nFirst, to rearrange this dorm room for comfort...And to hide his equipment. \n\n```Monologue 1: END```",

I have more suspicions that lead me to believe that the humans at this university willingly get into...\" entanglements \" with demons.
