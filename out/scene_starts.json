Just a couple of things: The demon activity here is turbulent, Touga's children all attend this University. He has 6 confirmed, I had the pleasure of meeting at least 4 of them in the school chatroom. They are spoiled, sex-depraved, vulgar, and reckless...As most young demons seem to be. However, the Sakamaki's, to my knowledge are the royal bloods, right? You would think they would be trained for, well, the crown. Just odd for them to act so crudely, and so matter-of-fact. Unless they're faking for the sake of blending in? Anyway, I searched through the chatroom...Shu Sakamaki, Reiji Sakamaki, Ayato Sakamaki, Kanato Sakamaki, Laito Sakamaki, Subaru Sakamaki...I will do my best to gain more information on the six of them, but please telecom me back with any info you have on them. They seem to be the next bloodline closest to Touga...\n\nAnyway, next...\"Rosenfeld\", this name rings a bell for me as well. He is currently running the art club here in the school. My initial impression of him is that he's smart...But he seems careful, guarded even. I'll have a chance to actually meet him physically this Friday (The art club meets every week, apparently). I'll try to speak with him more then, hopefully I can get him alone. I know there are more demons that just vampires\u2026There was mentions of Vibora and Alen? Alden? Something of that nature...I want to learn more about these creatures. There might be some of them at this school and I just haven't seen the signs. \n\nLastly...\"Mukami\", this is kind of a reach...But I feel like there is significance in this name, too. Looking through the chat roaster, there were four of them. Someone mentioned that the one named Kou Mukami is famous in Japan, idol business or something like that. Again, this is just from whispers, but the name \"Mukami\" is making the hair on the back of my neck stand up...Ruki Mukami, Yuma Muka",

I've been keeping in contact with a human student: Michi Tamura. They seem to be heavily involved with some of the demons in the school. I have more suspicions that lead me to believe that the humans at this university willingly get into...\" entanglements \" with demons. I guess this shouldn't come as a surprise considering these creatures are good at deception. Maybe I should get into one in order to seem less suspicious? I'll update you on this matter later. \n\nTonight I will be in close proximity to a possible demon royal...Alrick Rosenfeld. I don't think anything major will happen, however,  please advise. I would like to request more equipment if possible. \n\n``` Lysander sends out a requisition form for the following: Experimental demon perfumes, tranquilizers, demon restraints, silver, and temporary repellents.``` \n\nI will keep in touch~ \n\n- The Hawk\n\n``` Telecom 2: END```",

Just enough to wear off the remaining adrenaline in the hunter's system...\n\nHe scans his membership card at the front and walks through the double doors of the gym machinery room. He wore small backpack, black, skin-tight shirt, and greyish basketball shorts with white sneakers; and his hair slicked back with a headband, along with his RBF...His real default expression. Aoi's presence in the room immediately caught him off guard, and he became aware of the other two people within the room as well...As he thought, he could never let his guard down in this city, as much as he wanted to...He is constantly reminded of demon's existence, it was almost overwhelming at times...\n\n_Ayos Mio! Of course he's here...Just going to pretend I didn't notice him for now...Both him and the little blonde one [Shou] mentioned they want nothing to do with me. We'll see about that..._\n\nSetting his backpack and water into one of the little cubbies near the Leg-Press Machine, Lysander makes sure the weight and settings were to his liking. Finally putting his headphones in as he settled his body onto the seat of the machine. He wanted to be immersed in his workout...But with a certain someone being in the same vicinity, he made sure to keep aware of what _he_ might do. \n\n@AOI NAKASHIMA",

It seems like demons have been more liberal about exposing themselves than he expected...Shou, Aoi, and surprisingly Noah. His commander's intuitions about demon activity in Kaminashi were not only spot-on, but in an abundance, it was almost overwhelming. But Lysander didn't let it stress him out too much, this was his biggest challenge yet; he just had to be conscious of his work load--and remember to take breaks. Thus, leading him here! With another suspected demon...\n\n_He was insistent on hanging out...Is this a \"hang out\" as friends? A date? Is he planning on attacking me? What does he want? I couldn't tell what his intent was...Even when he had me inches away from him...And going by what Alrick and Elise say about me...? With how jumpy Alrick was in our last encounter, I'm assuming it wasn't in a positive light...Hmm..._  \n\nThe hunter couldn't quite put his finger on who Lucien _really_ was...Even though he was supposed to be using this invitation as a means of relaxation; he felt that he couldn't fully relax around him. But only spent time with the man will tell. Lysander snaps himself out of his thoughts, he realized he was spending too much time standing around...He approaches the front desk with a smile. \n\n\"Hello sir! Do you have a reservation with us?\" The woman speaks with a chipper, welcoming voice.  \n\n\"Yes. 'Lucien' should be the name, I believe...Or 'Demos', I think.\" Lysander struggled to remember how to pronounce 'Lucien' and 'Demos' in Japanese [the accent associated], hoping the lady understood him enough. She opens a giant, fancy, black book, shifting through the pages to the one with the current date stamped on the top of the page. Her pointer finger glides down the page of what he assumes to be names, dates, and times...\n\n\"Hmm...Ah! Here we go. `Lucien Demos: Party of 2: Full Payment Completed`, perfect!

His green locks were brushed out to cup his face in a flattering manner, and wore loose, Bohemian-like clothes, being sure to have his neck and partial shoulders exposed,  giving him more of an androgynous appearance. Adding on a sleeved shawl, silver rings on his index and ring fingers (for both hands), and his most trusted silver cross necklace...He messed around with his hair one more time, before heading out of his dorm and onto school grounds. \n\n*That's the best I can do for now...At least I look good for my age~ We will see how well these techniques work on the demons of Japan!

Maybe it didn't mean anything, but this school was old, it has to mean _something_, right?\n\nThoughts of known demonic history, cryptic history, and other supernatural happenings swirl through Lysander's mind like a history book being flipped through.

Today was uneventful and full of nothing but paperwork for the overworked hunter. This moment, here in front of Noah, was his only peace he got from the clacking of his keyboard and white noise of his PC. The lack of sleep and a hint of grogginess could be heard in Lysander\u2019s tone. The aches in his neck and shoulders were stiffening his posture, but he was insistent in helping the poor boy with his studies. \n\n\u201cThis one\u2014\u201c, He taps the page. \u201cIs a compound because of this particular criteria\u2026It\u2019s hard to spot when you first learn of these, but with practice\u2014You\u2019ll be a pro in no time\u2026\u201d\n\nLysander\u2019s words trickled through his lips like a waterfall. Regurgitating information from when _he_ was last in college at this point. He almost didn\u2019t even notice Noah\u2019s absence until dark eyes travels back up to his flushed face. \n\n The hunter paused, staring straight into Noah\u2019s half lidded eyes. Only thought that came across Lysander\u2019s mind, was how porcelain the boy appeared\u2026Like a collector\u2019s favorite doll\u2026_How does a petite man like Noah safely navigate a place like this?_ He wonders. \n\n\u201c\u2026I hope I\u2019m not boring you. Do you want to take a break?\u201d The ends of his mouth come to a slight upward curve. \n\n@NOAH LAFAYETTE",
